# CONWAY-S-GAME-OF-LIFE-IN-GOLANG
Simple Solution of Conway's Game of Life
 The universe of the Game of Life is is represented as a two dimensional array of (m x n) cells which is wrapped to simulate infinite two dimensional array, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive (1) or dead (0). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent(neighbours).
 

Have to provide the inputs listed below:
1. m and n value of the two dimensional array (grid).
2. Number of generations to run.
3. Number of live cells at zeroth generation 
4. List of positions (i, j) of the live cells at zeroth generation.
